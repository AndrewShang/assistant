## Integration limits
{: #integration-limits}

The number of integrations you can create in a single service instance depends on your {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} plan.

| Service plan     | Integrations per assistant |
|------------------|---------------------------:|
| Premium          |                        100 |
| Standard         |                        100 |
| Lite*            |                        100 |

## Add an integration
{: #add-integration}

After you add a conversational skill to an assistant, a test web site is provisioned for you automatically. It has a simple chat widget interface that you can use to interact with your assistant for testing purposes. You can also share the URL to the IBM-branded site with any teammembers who might want to try the assistant. The tile named **Shareable Link** that is displayed in the Integrations section represents this site.

Follow these steps to add integrations to your assistant:

1.  Click the **Assistants** tab.

1.  Click to open the tile for the assistant that you want to integrate.

1.  In the Integrations section, click **Add integration**.

1.  Click the **Select Integration** button for the platform with which you want to integrate the assistant. The options include:

    - Facebook Messenger
    - Slack
    - Shareable Link

1.  Click **Select Integration**.

1.  Follow the instructions that are provided on the screen to complete the integration process.

After you integrate the assistant, test it from the target platform to ensure that the assistant works as expected.
