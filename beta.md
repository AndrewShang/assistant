# Early access program
{: #beta}

When you participate in the early access program, IBM gives you early access to features for your evaluation. These features are classified as beta, which means they might be unstable, might change frequently, and might be discontinued with short notice. Beta features also might not provide the same level of performance or compatibility that generally available features provide and are not intended for use in a production environment. Beta features are supported only on the [IBM Developer Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/watson-assistant/){: external}.

## Available beta features
{: #beta-features}

The following features are available for use by participants in the early access program only. To find out how to request access, see [Participate in the early access program](/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-feedback#feedback-beta).
