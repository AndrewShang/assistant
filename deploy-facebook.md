# Integrating with Facebook Messenger
{: #deploy-facebook}

Facebook Messenger is a mobile messaging application that helps businesses and customers communicate directly with one another.
{: shortdesc}

After you configure a dialog skill and add it to an assistant, you can integrate the assistant with Facebook Messenger.

1.  From the Assistants tab, click to open the assistant tile that you want to deploy.

1.  From the Integrations section, click **Add Integration**.

1.  Click the **Select Integration** button for *Facebook Messenger*.

1.  Follow the instructions that are provided on the screen to complete the integration process.

## Dialog considerations
{: #facebook-dialog}

The rich responses that you add to a dialog behave in the following ways when they are displayed in a Facebook app:

- **Connect to human agent**: This response type is ignored.

- **image**: This response type embeds an image in the response. A title and description are not displayed before the image, whether you specify them or not.

- **option**: This response type shows a list of options that the user can choose from.

  - If you specify a title, it is displayed before the list of options.
  - A description is not displayed, whether you specify one or not.
  - After a user clicks one of the buttons, the button choices disappear and are replaced by the user input that is generated by the user's choice. If the assistant or the user enters new input, then the button-generated input disappears. Therefore, if you include multiple response types in a single response, position the option response type last. Otherwise, content from subsequent responses, such as text from a text response type, will replace the button-generated text.

- **pause**: This response type pauses the assistant's activity in the Messenger. However, activity does not resume after the pause unless another response type is triggered after it. Whenever you include this response type, add another, different response type, such as a text response, and position it after this one.

## Chatting with the assistant

To start a chat with the assistant, complete the following steps:

1.  Open Facebook Messenger.
1.  Type the name of the page you created earlier.
1.  After the page comes up, click it, and then start chatting with the assistant.

The dialog flow for the current session is restarted after 60 minutes of inactivity (5 minutes for Lite and Standard plans). This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 60 (or 5) minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their default values.
