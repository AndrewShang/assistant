# Integrating with Slack
{: #deploy-slack}

Slack is a cloud-based messaging application that helps people collaborate with one another.
{: shortdesc}

After you configure a conversational skill and add it to an assistant, you can integrate the assistant with Slack.

1.  From the Assistants tab, click to open the assistant tile that you want to deploy.

1.  From the Integrations section, click **Add Integration**.

1.  Click the **Select Integration** button for *Slack*.

1.  Follow the instructions that are provided on the screen to complete the integration process.

## Dialog considerations
{: #slack-dialog}

The rich responses that you add to a dialog behave in the following ways when they are displayed in a Slack channel:

- **Connect to human agent**: This response type is ignored.

- **option**: This response type shows a list of options that the user can choose from.

  - If you specify a title, it is displayed before the list of options.
  - A desciption is not displayed, whether you specify one or not.
  - After a user clicks one of the buttons, the button choices disappear and are replaced by the user input generated by the user's choice. If you include multiple response types in a single response, position the option response type last. Otherwise, the output will contain a mix of responses and user inputs that might confuse the user.

- **pause**: This response type pauses the assistant's activity in the Slack channel. However, no visible indicator is shown to indicate that the assistant is paused, whether you choose to show typing or not.

## Chatting with the assistant

To start a chat with the assistant, complete the following steps:

1.  Open Slack, and go to the workspace associated with your app.
1.  Click the application that you created from the Apps section.
1.  Chat with the assistant.

The dialog flow for the current session is restarted after 60 minutes of inactivity. Meaning if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 60 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their default values.
