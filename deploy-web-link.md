# Testing with a web link
{: #deploy-web-link}

After you have configured your conversational skill and added it to an assistant, you can quickly deploy the assistant by integrating it into a simple IBM-branded web page. You can then share the URL of the page with others to enlist help in testing and getting feedback about the assistant.

To integrate the assistant into a web page, complete the following steps:

1.  From the Assistants tab, click to open the assistant tile that you want to deploy.

1.  From the Integrations section, click **New integration**.

1.  Choose **Web link** from the list of options.
