# Integrations overview

After you have configured your conversational skill and added it to an assistant, you can deploy your assistant by connecting it to the interfaces that your customers use. You can also connect your skill to other services (including other {{site.data.keyword.watson}} services) in various ways.

- [**Testing in Slack**](test-deploy.html): You can use the test deployment tool to quickly deploy a chat bot in a Slack channel, using your assistant and a prebuilt Slack app. This option is the fastest and easiest way to test your assistant, but it has limitations.

- [**Deploying to a channel with the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} connector**](conversation-connector.html): You can use the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} connector to deploy a chat bot to Slack or Facebook Messenger, using your assistant and your own Slack or Facebook app.

- [**Building a client application**](develop-app.html): You can use the {{site.data.keyword.watson}} SDK for the language of your choice to develop your own application front end. Your application can then use the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} APIs to communicate with the service, while also integrating with third-party services and your own business systems.

- [**Building a bot with Botkit**](integrations.html): You can use the Botkit framework to integrate your assistant with social media and messaging channels.
