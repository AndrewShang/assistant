## Step 2: Create an assistant
{: #create-assistant}

Your first step in the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} tool is to create an assistant.

An [*assistant*](assistants.html) is a cognitive bot to which you add skills that enable it to interact with your customers in useful ways.

1.  From the home page of the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} tool, click the **Assistants** tab.
1.  Click **Create new**.
1.  Name the assistant `Watson Assistant tutorial`.
1.  In the Description field, enter, `This is a sample assistant that I am creating to help me learn`.
1.  **Optional**. If you want to create an assistant that communicates in a language other than English, then choose the appropriate language from the list.
1.  Click **Create**.

## Step 3: Add a conversational skill to your assistant
{: #add-skill}

A [*conversational skill*](create-convo-skill.html) is a container for the artifacts that define the flow of a conversation that your assistant can have with your customers.

1.  From the new assistant page, click **Add skill**.

    **Note**: If you created or were given developer role access to any workspaces that were built with the Watson Conversation service, you will see them listed on the Skills page as conversational skills.

1.  Click **New skill**.
1.  Give your skill the name `Conversational skill tutorial`.
1.  **Optional**. If the dialog you plan to build will use a language other than English, then choose the appropriate language from the list.
1.  Click **Create**. You ºll land on the **Intents** tab of your new skill.

## Step 4: Create intents
{: #create-intents}

An [intent](intents.html) represents the purpose of a user's input. You can think of intents as the actions your users might want to perform with your application.

For this example, we're going to keep things simple and define only two intents: one for saying hello, and one for saying goodbye.

1.  Make sure you're on the Intents tab. (You should already be there, if you just created the skill.)
1.  Click **Add intent**.
1.  Name the intent `hello`, and then click **Create intent**.
1.  Type `hello` into the **Add user example** field, and then press **Enter**.

   *Examples* tell the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service what kinds of user input you want to match to the intent. The more examples you provide, the more accurate the service can be at recognizing user intents.
1.  Add four more examples:
    - `good morning`
    - `greetings`
    - `hi`
    - `howdy`

1.  Click the **Close** ![Close arrow](images/close_arrow.png) icon to finish creating the #hello intent.
1.  Create another intent named #goodbye with these five examples:
    - `bye`
    - `farewell`
    - `goodbye`
    - `I'm done`
    - `see you later`

You've created two intents, #hello and #goodbye, and provided example user input to train {{site.data.keyword.watson}} to recognize these intents in your users' input.

## Step 5: Add intents from a content catalog
{: #add-catalog}

Add training data that was built by IBM to your workspace by adding intents from a content catalog. In particular, you will give your assistant access to the `Business Information` content catalog so your dialog can address user requests for company contact information.

1.  In the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} tool, click the **Content Catalog** tab.
1.  Find **Business Information** in the list, and then click **Add to skill**.
1.  Open the **Intents** tab to review the intents and associated example utterances that were added to your training data. You can recognize them because each intent name begins with the prefix `#Business_Information_`. You will add the `#Business_Information_Contact_Us` intent to your dialog in a later step.

You have successfully supplemented your training data with prebuilt content provided by IBM.

## Step 6: Build a dialog
{: #build-dialog}

A [dialog](dialog-overview.html) defines the flow of your conversation in the form of a logic tree. Each node of the tree has a condition that triggers it, based on user input.

We'll create a simple dialog that handles our #hello and #goodbye intents, each with a single node.

### Adding a start node

1.  In the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} tool, click the **Dialog** tab.
1.  Click **Create**. You'll see two nodes:
    - **Welcome**: Contains a greeting that is displayed to your users when they first engage with the assistant.
    - **Anything else**: Contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized.

1.  Click the **Welcome** node to open it in the edit view.
1.  Replace the default response with the text, `Welcome to the Watson Assistant tutorial!`.
1.  Click ![Close](images/close.png) to close the edit view.

You created a dialog node that is triggered by the `welcome` condition, which is a special condition that indicates that the user has started a new conversation. Your node specifies that when a new conversation starts, the system should respond with the welcome message.

### Testing the start node

You can test your dialog at any time to verify the dialog. Let's test it now.

- Click the ![Ask Watson](images/ask_watson.png) icon to open the "Try it out" pane. You should see your welcome message.

### Adding nodes to handle intents

Now let's add nodes to handle our intents between the `Welcome` node and the `Anything else` node.

1.  Click the More icon ![More options](images/kabob.png) on the **Welcome** node, and then select **Add node below**.
1.  Type `#hello` in the **Enter a condition** field of this node. Then select the **#hello** option.
1.  Add the response, `Good day to you.`
1.  Click ![Close](images/close.png) to close the edit view.
1.  Click the More icon ![More options](images/kabob.png) on this node, and then select **Add node below** to create a peer node. In the peer node, specify `#Business_Information_Contact_Us` as the condition.
1.  Add the following text as the response.

    `Call us at 800-426-4968 or give us your feedback at https://www.ibm.com/scripts/contact/contact/us/en.`
1.  Click the More icon ![More options](images/kabob.png) on this node, and then select **Add node below** to create another peer node. In the peer node, specify `#goodbye` as the condition, and `OK. See you later!` as the response.

### Testing intent recognition

You  built a simple dialog to recognize and respond to both hello and goodbye inputs. Let's see how well it works.

1.  Click the ![Ask Watson](images/ask_watson.png) icon to open the "Try it out" pane. There's that reassuring welcome message.
1.  At the bottom of the pane, type `Hello` and press Enter. The output indicates that the #hello intent was recognized, and the appropriate response (`Good day to you.`) appears.
1.  Try the following input:
    - `bye`
    - `howdy`
    - `see ya`
    - `good morning`
    - `sayonara`

1.  Enter `Who can I call if I have questions?` and press Enter. The output indicates that the `#Business_Information_Contact_Us` intent was recognized, and the response that you added for it is displayed.

{{site.data.keyword.watson}} can recognize your intents even when your input doesn't exactly match the examples you included. The dialog uses intents to identify the purpose of the user's input regardless of the precise wording used, and then responds in the way you specify.

### Result of building a dialog

That's it. You created a simple conversation with two intents and a dialog to recognize them.

## Step 7: Integrate the assistant
{: #integrate-assistant}

Now that you have an assistant that can participate in a simple conversational exchange, publish it to the Facebook Messenger messaging channel to test it out.

1.  Go to the `Watson Assistant tutorial` page.
1.  Click **Add integration**.
1.  Choose **Facebook Messenger** as the channel integration.
1.  Follow the instructions to complete the integration.
1.  From the Facebook Messenger user interface, add the assistant as a contact.
1.  Say `hello` to your assistant, and watch it respond.

## Next steps
{: #next-steps}

This tutorial is built around a simple example. For a real application, you'll need to define some more interesting intents, some entities, and a more complex dialog that uses them both.
