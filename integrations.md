# Building a bot with BotKit

If you want customers to be able to communicate with your assistant through social media and messaging channels, you can use the [Botkit ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://howdy.ai/botkit){: new_window} middleware plugin.

This plugin enables developers to easily integrate an assistant with multiple social channels, including Slack, Facebook, and Twilio. After these integrations are established, customers can have simultaneous, independent conversations with your assistant through different channels.

To use the Botkit middleware plugin, clone or download the [GitHub repository ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/botkit-middleware){: new_window}.
