# About the Improve component

The Improve component of {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} provides a history of interactions with users of your conversational skill. You can use this history to improve your skill's understanding of users' inputs.
{: shortdesc}

Sections of the **Improve** panel:

* [Overview](logs_oview.html): A summary of interactions of users with a conversational skill.
* [User conversations](logs_convo.html): A list of user utterances. You can update intents and entities while viewing an individual user utterance. **Note**: A single user conversation may consist of multiple utterances.
* [Recommendations](logs_recommend.html): Ways to improve your system. Available only to Premium users.

## Improving across skills
To understand how to use utterance data to make improvements across skills, it is helpful to review the following definitions associated with the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service:

* ***Instance:*** Your deployment of {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, accessible with unique credentials. A {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} instance may be made up of multiple skills
* ***Skill:*** A skill is one model of your {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} training data
* ***User***: A user is anyone who interacts with your skill; often these are your customers
* ***Utterance***: An utterance is a single message a user sends to the skill
* ***Conversation***: A set of related exchanges (utterances and responses) that a user has with your skill
* ***Conversation ID***: A unique identifier used to link related exchanges
* ***Workspace ID:*** The unique identifier of a skill, that allows you to call your content
* ***Deployment ID:*** Unique labels that are passed with user utterances to help identify the deployment environment that the utterances come from
* ***Customer ID***: A unique label that can identify a specific user of your skill

Creating a conversational skill is a very iterative process. While you develop your skill, you use the *Try it out* pane to verify that your skill recognizes the correct intents and entities in test inputs, and to make corrections as needed.

In the **Improve** panel, you can view information about actual interactions with your users, and make similar corrections to improve the accuracy with which intents and entities are recognized by your skill. It is difficult to know exactly *how* your users will ask questions, or what random utterances they may make, so it is important to frequently visit the **Improve** panel, in order to improve your skills.

For a {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} instance that includes multiple skills, there may be times when it is useful to use utterance data from one skill to improve another skill within that same instance. **Note**: If you are a {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} Premium user, your premium instances can optionally be configured to allow access to log data from skills across your different premium instances.

As an example, say you have a {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} instance named *HelpDesk*. You may have both a Production skill and a Development skill in your HelpDesk instance. When working in the Development skill, you can filter utterances based on the `Deployment ID` for the Production skill, so that you are using Production skill utterances to improve your Development skill.

Any edits you then make within the Development skill will only affect the Development skill, even if youâ€™re using Production skill utterances. See [Selecting a data source](logs_convo.html#select-source) for additional information.

To specify the Deployment ID for an utterance sent using the `/message` API, include the deployment property inside the metadata object in your [context ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation/api/v1/#send_message){: new_window}, as in this example:
{: #deploy_id}

```json
"context" : {
  "metadata" : {
       "deployment": "HelpDesk-Production"
  }
}
```

{: #codeblock}

## Enabling user metrics
{: #user_id}

User metrics allow you to see, for example, the number of active users (unique users) who have engaged with your skill, or the average number of conversations per user over a given time interval on the [Overview page](logs_oview.html). User metrics are enabled by using a unique `User ID` parameter.

To specify the `User ID` for an utterance sent using the `/message` API, include the `user_id` property inside the metadata object in your [context ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation/api/v1/#send_message){: new_window}, as in this example::

```
"context" : {
  "metadata" : {
       "user_id": "{UserID}"
  }
}
```
{: #codeblock}

<!-- ### Querying data
Use the `/logs` API `filter` parameter to search a skill log for specific user data. For example, to search for data specific to a `User ID` that matches `my_best_customer`, the query might be:

```
curl -X GET
 --user {username}:{password}
 --data 'https://gateway.watson.net/conversation/api/v1/workspaces/{workspaceID}/logs?version=2018-02-16&filter=(language::en,request.header.metadata.user_id::my_best_customer)'
```
{: #codeblock}

See the [Filter query reference](filter-reference.html) for additional details. -->

## Deleting utterance data from specific users
{: #customer_id}

There might come a time when you want to completely remove a set of utterances between a specific user and your {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} instance. For example, under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), individuals are entitled to have their personal information, which may be included in utterances, removed upon request. Those utterances will then no longer be available when you [select a data source](logs_convo.html#select-source) to improve understanding.

### Prerequisite
To delete utterances which may contain personal information for one or more individuals, you first need to associate an utterance with a unique `Customer ID` for each individual that may have personal information in the utterance. To specify the `Customer ID` for any utterance sent using the `/message` API, include the `X-Watson-Metadata: customer_id` property in your header. You can pass multiple `Customer ID` entries with semicolon separated `field=value` pairs, using `customer_id`, as in the following example:

```
curl -X POST
 --user {username}:{password}
 --header
   'Content-Type: application/json'
   'Accept: application/json'
   'X-Watson-Metadata: customer_id={first-customer-ID};customer_id={second-customer-ID}'
 --data '{"input":{"text":"hello"}}' 'https://gateway.watson.net/conversation/api/v1/workspaces/{workspaceID}/message?version=2017-05-26'
```
{: #codeblock}

**Note**: The `customer_id` string cannot include the semicolon (`;`) or equal sign (`=`) characters.

**Note**: You are responsible for managing `Customer ID` parameters, and ensuring that each parameter is unique across your customers.

### Deleting data
To delete utterances with personal information for one or more individuals, you provide the `customer_id` semicolon separated `field=value` pairs to the `user_data` parameter.

**IMPORTANT**: Specifying a `customer_id` will delete *all* utterances with that `customer_id` across your entire {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} instance, not just within one skill.

As an example, to delete user ABC's data and user XYZ's data from your {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} instance, send the following cURL command:

```
curl -X DELETE
 --user {username}:{password}
 --data 'https://gateway.watson.net/conversation/api/v1/user_data/customer_id=abc;customer_id=xyz?version=2017-05-26'
```
{: #codeblock}


Each example returns an empty JSON object `{}`.
