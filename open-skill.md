# Opening assistants and skills
{: #open-skill}

Learn how to find and open assistants and skills that you created or can access.
{: shortdesc}

Assistants and skills are created within a {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service instance. To continue working with a skill or assistant, open the service instance that contains the skill or assistant. If you can't remember the service instance name, you can switch between instances from within the tool.

1.  Go to the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps).

1.  Log in.

    A list of the service instances that you own or were given access to is displayed.

1.  Click a service instance to open it.

1.  Click **Launch tool** from the service instance details page.

    The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} tool opens in a new browser tab and shows the home page of the tool.

1.  Take one of the following steps:

    - To find a skill, click the **Skills** tab.
    - To find an assistant, click the **Assistants** tab.

    Any skills or assistants that have been created in the current service instance are shown as tiles on the page. You can click a tile to open it.

    If you do not see the skill or assistant you are looking for, you can look for it in a different service instance. To switch to a different instance, find the current instance's name in the header, and then click **Change**. A list of your service instances is displayed. Click a different service instance to open it in the tool.
