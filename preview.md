# Preview details ![Technology preview experience only](images/preview.png)
{: #preview}

A select group of customers is being presented with a technology preview version of the product instead of the standard user experience. This topic describes the features that are available only to users of the Preview experience. 

The product documentation describes how to complete tasks in the standard user experience. Therefore, much of the content is not applicable to the version of the product you are using. Stay in the **Technology preview** section of the table of contents to find information about how to complete tasks in the preview user experience.
