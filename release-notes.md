# Release notes

## Changes
{: #change-log}

The following new features and changes to the service are available.

### 1 June 2018
{: #1June2018}

- You can now define rich responses types, such as buttons and images, in addition to text responses in your dialog. See for more details.

- Create entity annotations by labeling entity mentions that occur in your intent user examples. The annotated sentence is stored as an entity annotation. These entity annotations are then used by the service to teach your model about the context in which the entity is used in a sentence. Entity annotations are currently supported for English-language skills only.

### 7 May 2018

- You can now chat with a live IBM representative. Click the ![Help](images/help_icon.png) icon from the tooling header, and then click **Chat with support**.

### 12 April 2018
{: #12April2018}

- A group of select customers were given access to a private beta build of {{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}} for evaluation. The Beta introduces customers to a new way of building assistants, one that manages the orchestration of information from one dialog call to the next, and that simplifies the deployment process so the assistant can start helping customers faster. Read [this blog post ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2018/03/the-future-of-watson-conversation-watson-assistant/) for more details.
