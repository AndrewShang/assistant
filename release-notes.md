### 7 May 2018
{: #7May2018}

- You can now chat with a live IBM representative. Click the ![Help](images/help_icon.png) icon from the tooling header, and then click **Chat with support**.

### 12 April 2018
{: #12April2018}

- A group of select customers were given access to a private beta build of {{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}} for evaluation. The Beta introduces customers to a new way of building assistants, one that manages the orchestration of information from one dialog call to the next, and that simplifies the deployment process so the assistant can start helping customers faster. Read [this blog post ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2018/03/the-future-of-watson-conversation-watson-assistant/) for more details.
