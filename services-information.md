# IBM Cloud services information
{: #services-information}

The assistant is a fully hosted bot that is managed by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, which means you do not need to worry about setting up or maintaining infrastructure to support it.
{: shortdesc}

## Service plan information
{: #plans}

Explore the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} [service plan options ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/watson-assistant-formerly-conversation){: new_window}.

Before you create a service instance, decide how you want to organize the resources in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account. If you do not define your own resource group, the **default** resource group is used, and you *cannot* change it later. See [Best practices for organizing resources in a resource group ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/resources/bestpractice_rgs.html#bp_resourcegroups){: new_window} for more details.

### Plan limits by artifact type
{: #limits}

For information about artifact limits per plan, see these topics:

- [Assistants](create-assistant.html#assistant-limits)
- [Dialog nodes](dialog-build.html#dialog-node-limits)
- [Entities](entities.html#entity-limits)
- [Intents](intents.html#intent-limits)
- [Integrations](add-integrations.html#integration-limits)
- [Logs](logs.html#log-limits)
- [Skills](create-skill.html#skill-limits)

### API call limits
{: #api-limits}

The number of API calls allowed per instance depends on your service plan. See your plan description for details.

If you have a Lite plan and reach your API call limit, but the logs show that you have made fewer calls than expected, remember that the Lite plan stores log information for only 7 days.

If you want to upgrade from one plan to another, see [Upgrading](upgrading.html).

### Premium plan features
{: #premium}

The following features are available only to users of Premium plans.

- [Disambiguation](dialog-runtime.html#disambiguation)
- [Intent conflict resolution](intents.html#conflict-intents)
- [Intent user example recommendations](intents.html#intent-recommendations)

### User-based plans
{: #user-based-plans}

Unlike API-based plans, which measure usage by the number of API calls made during a specified timeframe, the new Plus plan and updated Premium plan use user-based billing. They measure usage by the number of unique users who interacted with the assistant during a specified timeframe.

The service uses the following information from API requests for billing purposes:

  - **user_id**: A property defined in the API that is sent in the context object of a /message API call. Using this property is the best way to ensure that you accurately attribute /message API calls to unique users. See the [v2 API reference documentation]( https://console.bluemix.net/apidocs/assistant-v2#send-user-input-to-assistant) for more information about where this is defined (`context.global.system.user_id`). For v1, the user ID is defined in `context.metadata.user_id`.
  - **session_id**: A property defined in the v2 API that identifies a single conversation between a user and the assistant. A session ID is provided in /message API calls that are generated by the built-in integrations. The session ends when a user closes the chat window or after the chat is inactive for 60 minutes.
  - **conversation_id**: A property defined in the v1 API that is stored in the context object of a /message API call. This property can be used to identify multiple /message API calls that are associated with a single conversational exchange with one user. However, the same ID is only used if you explicitly retain the ID and pass it back with each request that is made as part of the same conversation. Otherwise, a new ID is generated for each new /message API call.

To get the most benefit from the new user-based service plans, design any custom applications that you use to deploy your assistant to capture a unique user ID or session ID and pass the information to the service.

## Authenticating API calls
{: #authenticate-api-calls}

The authentication mechanism used by your service instance impacts how you must provide credentials when making an API call.

1.  Get the service credentials.

    - Click the service instance on the [Dashboard ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps?category=ai){: new_window}.

    - Click to open your service instance, click **Service credentials**, and then click **View credentials**.

      **Cloud Foundry credentials**

      ![Shows the service credentials page for Cloud Foundry-hosted instances.](images/cf-cred-ui.png)

      **IAM credentials**

      ![Shows the service credentials page for IAM-hosted instances.](images/iam-creds.png)

1.  Use these credentials in your API call.

    **Cloud Foundry API call**

    Provide your username and password credentials.

    ```curl
    curl -X GET \
    --user {username}:{password} \
    'https://gateway.watson.net/assistant/api/v1/workspaces?version=2018-09-20'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

     **IAM API call**

    - The base url must include the location. Use the syntax `gateway-<location>.watsonplatform.net` to specify the location in which you created the service instance. The location codes are listed in the *Data center locations* table.
    - Provide the appropriate type of token in the header. You can pass either a bearer token or an API key.

      - Tokens support authenticated requests without embedding service credentials in every call. The following example shows a bearer token being used.

        ```curl
        curl -X GET \
        'https://gateway-syd.watsonplatform.net/assistant/api/v1/workspaces?version=2018-09-20' \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUz......sgrKIi8hdFs'
        ```
        {: codeblock}

      - API keys use basic authentication. The following example shows an apikey being used.

        ```curl
        curl -X GET -u "apikey:3Df... ...Y7Pc9" \
        'https://gateway-us-east.watsonplatform.net/assistant/api/v1/workspaces?version=2018-09-20' \
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        **Note**: When you use any of the Watson SDKs, you can pass the API key and let the SDK manage the lifecycle of the tokens.

        IAM resources cannot be managed with the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI). For example, Cloud Foundry CLI commands (beginning with `cf`) that create or manage service instances do not work with instances hosted in locations using IAM. Instead, you must use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and its associated commands. See [Commands for managing resource groups and resources](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/bx_cli.html#commands-for-managing-resource-groups-and-resources) for more details.

        See [Authenticating with IAM tokens ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/watson/getting-started-iam.html){: new_window} for more information.

    For examples, see  [Authentication ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.{DomainName}/apidocs/assistant-v2#authentication){: new_window} for your language in the API reference.

### Data centers
{: #regions}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} has a network of global data centers that provide performance benefits to its cloud services. See [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} global data centers ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/data-centers/){: new_window} for more details.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} changed from managing user access with Cloud Foundry to using token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication. IAM was rolled out in different locations at different times. You can migrate a service instance to move it from its current Cloud Foundry org and space to a resource group. See [Migrating](migrating.html) for more details.

You can create {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service instances that are hosted in the following data center locations:

| Location    | Location code | Authentication type | IAM adoption date | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Dallas      | us-south      | IAM                 | 30 October 2018 | N/A |
| Frankfurt   | eu-de         | IAM                 | 30 October 2018 | N/A |
| Sydney      | au-syd        | IAM                 | 7 May 2018 | Instances created before May 7 were syndicated to Dallas |
| Tokyo       | jp-tok        | IAM                 | 8 November 2018 | N/A |
| United Kingdom |  eu-gb     | N/A                 | N/A        | Instances are syndicated to Dallas |
| Washington DC  | us-east    | IAM                 | 14 June 2018 | N/A |
