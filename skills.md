# Skills
{: #skills}

A skill is a container for the artificial intelligence that enables an assistant to help your customers.
{: shortdesc}

An assistant directs requests down the optimal path for solving a customer problem. Add skills so your assistant can provide a direct answer to a common question or reference more generalized search results for something more complex.

## Skill types
{: #skills-types}

You can add the following type of skill to your assistant:

- **[Dialog skill](#skills-dialog-skill)**: Understands typical questions or requests from users and answers or fulfills them by following a dialog that is scripted by you.

![Plus or Premium plan only](images/plus.png) If you are a Plus or Premium plan user, you can also create this type of skill:

- **[Search skill](#skills-search-skill)**: Answers a user's question by searching for relevant information from an external data source, extracting the passage, and returning it as the assistant's response.
