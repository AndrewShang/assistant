## Upgrading your plan
{: #upgrade-plan}

You can explore the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} [service plan options ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/pricing/){: new_window} to decide which plan is best for you.

You cannot upgrade a Cloud Foundry-based instance to a Plus plan. You must migrate the instance, so it is using a resource group before you can upgrade it. See [Migrating from Cloud Foundry](/docs/services/watson?topic=watson-migrate) for more details.
{: note}

To upgrade your plan, complete these steps:

1.  From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} menu, select **Upgrade Plan**.
    From here, you can see your current plan and other available plan options. Depending on the plan type, you can make changes yourself or inform IBM that you want to change your plan.

    For a Premium plan, all of the instances in the plan must be part of the same resource group.
    {: note} 

    Currently, you cannot upgrade from a Lite or Standard plan to a Plus plan. Instead, purchase the Plus plan first. Export skills from an instance in your existing plan and then import them to an instance in the Plus plan. To start the process of provisioning a Plus plan, fill out [this form ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://ibm.biz/contact-WA-plus).
